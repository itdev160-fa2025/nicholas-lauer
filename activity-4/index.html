                The NS7III is the ONLY motorized controller on the market today that gives the dedicated turntablist a true and authentic mixing and spinning experience. <br>
                With a Numark exclusive 3 full color LCD screens, the controller allows you to focus your attention on your mix, your controller, your audience, and your craft. <br>
                This controller offers features and performance that sets it way above conventional DJ controllers, even other so-called “top-of the line” units. This is the Big Daddy of controllers.

                <p>Board came in on time and everything works just fine. Love the LCD screens, though not necesary, they really take this up to the nxt level. Best one I ever had</p>

                <h3>skrillex number1 fan</h3>
                <p>Was happy at first. But, from what I've experienced in the first two months is the volume faders are spot welded to the board and can't be replaced. 
                    The welds are weak and tend to break causing volume cuts in the fader depending on pressure. You'd think they would design it like a cross fader for easy replacement. 
                    I don't know what to do at this point.</p>

                <h3>Nick Lauer</h3>
                <p>Hands down one of the best digital dj controllers out there. Built sturdy, this is the closest thing to real turntables there is. I've tried other motorized platter controllers, and
                    none of them come close to feeling as good as this one does. It is unfortunate that Pioneer has a hold on the controller industry because Numark has consistantly put out high quality products for a 
                    fraction of the price. Hoping a company will come out and compete at the higher end level soon as this controller is no longer supported by Numark and soon Serato</p>
